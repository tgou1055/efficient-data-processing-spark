-- Notes:
In Spark SQL, if you use DATEDIFF with an invalid date, it returns NULL because Spark 
handles invalid or unparseable dates by producing a NULL value rather than throwing an error. 
This behavior is in line with SQL's handling of invalid data, where operations involving NULL values 
result in NULL to ensure the query doesn't break due to parsing issues.

/*
In a database or data warehousing context, a "lineitem" typically refers to a row or entry 
in a table that represents a single item or detail line within a larger transaction or order. 
This term is often used in databases modeling transactional or business data, particularly 
in contexts like retail, sales, or order management systems. 

Each line item typically includes details about individual products or services associated with 
an order or invoice.
